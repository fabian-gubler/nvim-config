# google-java-format

Node repackaging of Google's native [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) tool

Very useful in libraries that wrap native java code in javascript

## Usage Example

1. (optional) `yarn add google-java-format` (or `npm -i google-java-format` if you prefer)
1. `npx google-java-format <path to java file>`

All arguments are passed directly to the underlying google-java-format tool, with the exception of `--glob`.

Multiple files as a glob must be pre-processed to avoid errors with command line arguments being too long

### Globbing files

`npx google-java-format -i --glob=folder/**/*.java`

This will find the matching files and run `google-java-format` on chunks of 30 files at a time, then show the total
formatted files at the end.

See [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) for globbing semantics.

### Auto-format

Use the `-i` or `--replace` argument to format the files by re-writing instead of printing the changes to stdout:

`npx google-java-format -i --glob=folder/**/*.java`

### Dry-run

To just check files use the `-n` (or `--dry-run`) parameter:

`npx google-java-format -n --glob=folder/**/*.java`

## Integrations

### Pre-commit

May be wrapped in git pre-commit if desired, there are [examples on line](https://github.com/justinludwig/gjfpc-hook) demonstrating this

If you would like to contribute a pre-commit hook, perhaps one that is Husky-compatible, that would be great! Open a PR with the hook and remove this comment :-)

### Github Actions

May be used in GitHub Actions workflows to verify PRs meet formatting standards,
as done in [Invertase](https://invertase.io) [react-native-firebase](https://github.com/Invertase/react-native-firebase/), specifically this `package.json` run script is called in a CI job and sets exit status correctly to fail the job if there are formatting inconsistencies found:

```json
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "lint:android": "google-java-format --set-exit-if-changed --replace --glob=\"packages/**/android/**/*.java\"",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
```

Something like that (with a glob that matches your java file roots) could work for you

## Inspiration

The wonderful [clang-format](https://github.com/angular/clang-format) from the Angular team is so useful, we wanted the same package for java formatting.

That package already solves so many of the little problems that occur with different platforms, and globbing etc - it's fantastic.

Go to [their repo](https://github.com/angular/clang-format), integrate it for objective-c code, and give them a star! They have earned it. Thanks for the code + inspiration Angular community!
