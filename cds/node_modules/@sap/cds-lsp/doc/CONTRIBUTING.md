### Users

You may use our issue tracking for bug reports, requirements, feature or improvement wishes or ideas.

- Use the  [CAP issue tracking](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/cap/issues/issues) and tag your ticket with the label ```in VSCode```.

- In case you spotted the problem in our sources or are absolutely sure your request is for ```@sap/cds-lsp``` - implementation wise(!) - you can use our [internal issue tracking](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/cdx/cds-lsp/issues). 

Note that some functionality of the CDS text editor is **not** implemented in ```@sap/cds-lsp``` itself e.g. most parts of the code completion or diagnostic messages are done in ```@sap/cds-compiler```. In doubt, use the CAP issue tracking.
